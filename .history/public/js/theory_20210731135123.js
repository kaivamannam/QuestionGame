    <p> In this theory guide, you will learn about <b>Bloom’s taxonomy</b> and <b>Depth of Knowledge</b>. 
    </p>
    <p> In simple terms, a taxonomy means a classification system. Benjamin Bloom created a hierarchical model with six levels of complexity. The higher the level, the tougher it is to think about it and come up with answers. The sequence of cognitive skills are Remembering, Understanding, Applying, Analysing, Evaluating, and Creating. 
    </p>    
    <p> The upper three levels (Create, Evaluate and Analyse) form the <b>HOTS</b> (Higher Order Thinking Skills). The bottom three levels(Remember, Understand and Apply) form the <b>LOTS</b> (Lower Order Thinking Skills). You should develop the ability to generate questions based on HOTS levels.

    <p>So what are these levels exactly? Let me explain these levels using examples. 
    </p>
    <p>1. The first level of Bloom’s Taxonomy is to <b>Remember</b>. Activities such as memorising a poem, recalling state capitals, remembering math formulas form the first level. </p>
    <p>2. The second level of Bloom’s Taxonomy is to <b>Understand</b>. Examples include making a list of people based on their characteristics, illustrate the difference between a rectangle and a square, or even summarize a story or a speech.</p>
    <p>3. The third level of Bloom’s Taxonomy is to <b>Apply</b>. Examples include using a formula to solve a math problem, choosing a design to build a new place or revising parts of speech or text to achieve a purpose. 
    </p><p>
        4. The fourth level of Bloom’s Taxonomy is to <b>Analyze</b>. Examples include identify the ‘parts of’ democracy, explain how the steps of the scientific process work together, identify why a machine isn’t working
    </p><p>
        5. The fifth level of Bloom’s Taxonomy is to <b>Evaluate</b>.
    </p><p>
        Examples include making a judgment regarding an ethical dilemma, interpreting the significance of a given law of physics,  or illustrate the relative value of technological innovation in a specific setting. 
    </p><p>
        6.The sixth and highest level of Bloom’s taxonomy is to <b>Create</b>.
    </p><p>
        Examples include creating a new design to solve an ‘old’ problem, delete the least useful arguments in a persuasive essay, or write a poem or essay based on a given theme and tone
        That’s a lot of information. Please don’t worry about memorising them. Just remember, the higher the level, the more challenging the task or questions becomes. And that we have to target to develop questions based on the final three levels (Analyse, Evaluate and Create). 
    </p><p>
        Next is the Depth of Knowledge. Norman Webb created another classification model with four levels based on the amount of knowledge and knowledge processing required to answer a question. Higher the level, the greater the challenge.

    <p>
        Level 1. <b>Recall and Reproduction</b>: questions at this level require recall of facts or rote application of simple procedures. The task does not require any cognitive effort beyond remembering the right response or formula. 
    </p><p>
        Level 2. <b>Skills and Concepts></b>: At this level, a student must make some decisions about his or her approach. Tasks with more than one mental step, such as comparing, organizing, summarizing, predicting, and estimating, are usually Level 2.
    </p><p>
        Level 3. <b>Strategic Thinking</b>: At this level of complexity, students must use planning and evidence, and thinking is more abstract. A task with multiple valid responses, where students must justify their choices, would be Level 3. Examples include solving non-routine problems, designing an experiment, or analyzing characteristics of a genre.
    </p><p>
        Level 4. <b>Extended Thinking</b>: Level 4 tasks require the most complex cognitive effort. Students synthesize information from multiple sources, often over an extended period, or transfer knowledge from one domain to solve problems in another. Designing a survey and interpreting the results, analyzing multiple texts to extract themes, or writing an original story in a specific style would all be examples of Level 4.

        Quick question, given what you know about Bloom’s taxonomy and Depth of Knowledge, what would be a good challenging question or learning task? Answer? If the question is based on the final three levels of bloom’s taxonomy and the final two levels of Depth of knowledge, the question is a challenging one. Lesson for us, the next time we make a question in school or at home, think about increasing the challenge by going up one level in Bloom’s and Depth of knowledge.
